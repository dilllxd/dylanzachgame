# Dylan and Zach's game for Twitch Chat
This is our current prototype of a game that Twitch chat can play to earn currency on stream. This uses a multitude of servers/clients to connect together. Currently we use Godot to write the game client, we are using a python based websocket send/recieve server and finally Stream Avatars to host the currency system.
